👋 Hi, everyone! I am currently pursuing my master's degree at Harbin Institute of Technology, shenzhen. I have been under supervision of [Prof.Liqiang Nie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=yywVMhUAAAAJ). I am interested in VLM and GUI-agent. More specifically, my research focuses on improving the **efficiency** of MLLMs, as well as exploring **search and recommendation tasks** within MLLMs.

At the same time, I’m also interesting in running and other sports. I completed a **full marathon** (42.195 km) in Shijiazhuang, China(2024.03).
